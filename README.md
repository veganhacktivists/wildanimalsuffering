# WildAnimalSuffering.org

We tend to idealize nature and the lives of wild animals, but in reality, their
lives can be really tough. The suffering of wild animals matters. It matters to
them, and it should matter to us. This project aims to provide people with
information about the subject and tries to visualize the scale of it all.
