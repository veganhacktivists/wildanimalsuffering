    "When thinking about nature and the lives of wild animals, we often picture dolphins swimming in the ocean or elephants and lions roaming in the savannah. We mostly picture large adult animals living lives characterized by freedom. However, this rose-tinted view of nature doesn't even come close to representing the lives of most wild animals.",
    "In reality, the life of most wild animals is characterized not by freedom, but by struggle. They constantly deal with harsh weather, starvation, disease, and injuries, and much like a dog or a human would suffer in their position, they suffer as well."

They may be injured by predators or in intraspecific conflicts over territory or mating; burned by wildfires or frozen by sudden frosts; trapped by difficult terrain such as mud ponds or frozen lakes, and face painful, lingering deaths; or they might simply have an accident in the normal course of living their lives, just as humans do. Unlike humans, though, animals in the wild rarely have effective help available to them when they endure accidents or injuries. They find themselves almost helpless against stronger animals, extreme weather conditions, and natural traps. Nevertheless, humans do sometimes manage to rescue injured or trapped animals, even in difficult circumstances.",
  "types_of_suffering.accidents.title": "Accidents",
  "types_of_suffering.anthropogenic_harms.description": "Anthropogenic harms are harms caused by human beings that are the direct result of specific actions, either intentional or unintentional. Examples of intentional direct harm are fishing and hunting. Another example is the intentional eradication of certain animals. This may be for economic reasons, such as when they are killed because of their negative impact on agriculture. It can also be for conservationist purposes, as when animals are killed because of their impact on other species. Examples of unintentional direct harm are when animals are injured or killed by harvesting machines or being run over by vehicles. Indirectly anthropogenic harms include harms that result from human action but are not the direct result of concrete actions.",

  "types_of_suffering.disease_and_parasitism.description": "There are so many diseases that affect nonhuman animals in nature that they cannot all be listed here. Some of them are illnesses humans can suffer from too, like flu, pneumonia, tuberculosis, cholera, ebola, anthrax, E. coli, salmonella, diphtheria, and rabies. Cancer is also common in both land and marine animals. Some populations of whales suffer from cancer at similar rates to humans. Other common diseases that can infect animals living in the wild are distemper, chronic wasting disease, African swine fever, worms, and a variety of fungal infections. Parasite infestations are also common, and are more prevalent and severe in animals whose immune systems are weakened by other factors, such as infectious disease, weather, malnutrition, bodily changes, or stress due to antagonistic relationships with other animals.",
  "types_of_suffering.disease_and_parasitism.title": "Disease & parasitism",
  "types_of_suffering.harmful_weather_conditions.description": "Weather, especially temperature, plays a major role in influencing whether animals can survive and be healthy in certain habitats. Fluctuations in temperatures in certain regions can result in the deaths of entire populations. Many animals suffer due to changes in temperature. They may be fine during part of the year but experience great discomfort and hardship during a particularly hot summer or cold winter. In temperate areas - such as large parts of North America, Europe, and Asia - there can be big differences between the minimum and maximum temperatures during the summer and the winter. Animals who don’t hibernate or become dormant in cold weather have to endure large variations in temperature. This may weaken their immune systems and make them more susceptible to illness.",
  "types_of_suffering.harmful_weather_conditions.title": "Weather conditions",
  "types_of_suffering.natural_disasters.description": "Animals living in the wild are particularly vulnerable in natural disasters. Earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and forest fires can have devastating consequences. Many animals die, drowned or buried alive by dirt, ash, lava, or snow; crushed to death in collapsed or burnt burrows; smashed against trees and rocks, or pelted by hailstones. Others sustain major injuries, including cuts and abrasions to the eyes, wings and gills; respiratory and digestive disorders, eroded teeth; malnutrition; and poisoning from contaminated food and water. Strong volcanic eruptions and fires can temporarily change regional weather, cooling or heating the air, changing winds, or causing rain.",
  "types_of_suffering.natural_disasters.title": "Natural disasters",
  "types_of_suffering.predation.description": "Animals who are preyed upon are killed and eaten in varied ways. Some predators routinely eat the animals alive. Some animals, such as herons and some species of snakes, swallow their prey whole and digest them alive. It's difficult to estimate the suffering undergone by animals while they are being hunted and killed. It’s important to note that as well as feeling pain when attacked, prey animals may experience psychological distress from living in fear of predators.",
  "types_of_suffering.predation.title": "Predation",
  "types_of_suffering.thirst_and_starvation.description": "Animals in the wild are suffering from starvation and dehydration, and it is easy to underestimate this problem. For instance, if an animal is on the verge of starving to death, they will be more susceptible to being caught by predators. We might think that predation is why the animal died, when the root cause of that happening was actually weakness or more risky behaviours due to starvation. When we consider the reproductive strategies and population dynamics of wild animals, it seems that the problem of resource scarcity is likely to be a significant source of suffering.",

  "proposed_solutions.description": "The scale of wild animal suffering might seem overwhelming, but the actions that we take make an immense difference to individual animals. People around the world are already working on practical solutions and you can be one of them. Here's how:",
  "proposed_solutions.research.title": "Research and Development",
  "proposed_solutions.research.description1": "We need better ways to help wild animals, and that starts with research. Scientists are working to understand how animals experience life in the wild, what causes them the most suffering, and which interventions actually work.",
  "proposed_solutions.research.description2": "This includes studying how to measure animal wellbeing in the wild, population dynamics, and ecosystem impacts. As researchers learn more about wild animal welfare, they can guide policymakers and wildlife managers toward practices that truly help animals rather than just preserving ecosystems.",
  "proposed_solutions.research.description3": "Right now, <1>scientists are figuring out</1> how to implement many of the more direct interventions discussed below, such as developing outreach strategies to help more people understand why wild animal welfare matters.",
  "proposed_solutions.research.how_to_help": "Support organizations like Wild Animal Initiative that fund welfare biology research. If you're academically inclined, consider studying animal welfare science, ecology, environmental studies, animal behavior, or other related fields. You can also start a reading group in your community to discuss these ideas with others.",
  "proposed_solutions.disease_control.title": "Preventing Disease",
  "proposed_solutions.disease_control.description1": "Vaccination programs have already saved millions of wild animals from painful deaths.",
  "proposed_solutions.disease_control.description2": "Oral rabies vaccination shows exactly what's possible. Europe eliminated 99% of rabies in foxes since the 1980s by dropping vaccine-filled baits from aircraft. North America created massive rabies-free zones for raccoons, preventing thousands of deaths from a disease that attacks the nervous system and causes weeks of suffering.",
  "proposed_solutions.disease_control.description3": "The same approach works for other diseases. Prairie dogs get vaccinated against plague before it wipes out entire colonies. Wild birds are protected from flu viruses that cause painful respiratory infections and, ultimately, death. Each program requires custom vaccine formulations with strategic delivery mechanisms and careful monitoring to track how well they're working.",
  "proposed_solutions.disease_control.how_to_help": "Volunteer with local wildlife disease monitoring programs, or push for more government funding for vaccination programs through organizations like the Wildlife Disease Association.",
  "proposed_solutions.policy_advocacy.title": "Changing Laws and Policies",
  "proposed_solutions.policy_advocacy.description1": "Policy change means pushing for laws that protect wild animals from human-caused harm and, where possible, reduce natural suffering too. This includes stopping harmful practices such as wild animal trafficking, overhunting, or exploitation for entertainment. It can also mean helping reduce suffering due to natural harms such as natural disasters, disease, or starvation.",
  "proposed_solutions.policy_advocacy.description2": "Policy change can also mean adding animal welfare to government decision-making processes. Sometimes policy change doesn't help animals immediately, but it can increase funding for wild animal welfare research and set the stage for bigger changes later.",
  "proposed_solutions.policy_advocacy.description3": "This work often means teaming up with conservationists, scientists, and lawmakers. It's complex because traditional conservation can help some animals while harming others, but the goal is creating evidence-based policies that actually reduce suffering.",
  "proposed_solutions.policy_advocacy.how_to_help": "Support policy organizations like Animal Ethics or Faunalytics that research and advocate for wild animal welfare considerations in government planning. Contact your representatives about including animal welfare in environmental impact studies.",
  "proposed_solutions.spreading_awareness.title": "Spreading Awareness",
  "proposed_solutions.spreading_awareness.description1": "Raising awareness is key to building the cultural and political support that makes all other solutions possible. This means writing articles and op-eds, creating content, hosting university events, and having conversations that help people understand wild animal welfare.",
  "proposed_solutions.spreading_awareness.description2": "These efforts help normalize caring about wild animals, attract new researchers and funders, and create the cultural foundation needed for direct interventions.",
  "proposed_solutions.spreading_awareness.how_to_help": "Share articles and create content about wild animal welfare. If you enjoy writing, contribute to blogs, newspapers, or academic publications. You can organize screenings of the <1>Introduction to Wild Animal Video Course</1> by Animal Ethics, as well as online or in person talks with experts in the field. Encourage science magazines to cover these issues more. Attend environmental or animal advocacy events and bring up wild animal welfare when talking to the participants.",

  "proposed_solutions.helping_animals_near_us.description1": "Wild animals live everywhere, not just in remote wilderness. Many live in cities, villages, and farmland where both human activities and natural factors harm them. Scientists call these \"synanthropic animals,\" and there are concrete ways to make their lives better.",
  "proposed_solutions.helping_animals_near_us.description2": "We can prevent vehicle strikes with wildlife crossings, design buildings that don't kill birds, replace lethal population control with contraception, build shelters for harsh weather, and implement health measures that protect both animals and humans from disease transmission.",
  "proposed_solutions.helping_animals_near_us.how_to_help": "Advocate in your own community for measures that help local wild animals. If you live in a city, check out the <1>Wild Animal Welfare in Local Policies on Land Use and the Built Environment</1> report from NYU's Wild Animal Welfare Program, which offers practical ideas that city officials have already embraced.",
  "proposed_solutions.disaster_relief.title": "Disaster Relief for Animals",
  "proposed_solutions.disaster_relief.description1": "Wild animals suffer tremendously during extreme weather, storms, droughts, tornadoes, floods, fires, and earthquakes. While people sometimes rescue animals during disasters, we could help far more if institutions included wild animals in their emergency response plans.",
  "proposed_solutions.disaster_relief.description2": "Currently, disaster response focuses only on human safety and economic concerns. Animals are forgotten, even though they suffer and die in much higher numbers. Prevention helps too, creating shelters and escape routes can save many lives.",
  "proposed_solutions.disaster_relief.how_to_help": "Work with local groups that help wild animals during disasters, or start one if none exists. Publicize your rescue efforts to inspire others. Campaign for public agencies to include animals in their disaster response plans.",
  "proposed_solutions.treating_parasites.title": "Treating Parasites",
  "proposed_solutions.treating_parasites.description1": "Imagine eliminating a parasite that eats animals alive from an entire continent. It's already happened.",
  "proposed_solutions.treating_parasites.description2": "Screwworms used to torture countless animals across North America. These maggots literally eat animals from the inside out, causing weeks of agony before death. Today, they're completely gone from North America thanks to the \"sterile insect technique,\" a humane method that releases sterilized male flies to prevent reproduction without killing existing populations. The <1>Screwworm Free Future</1> campaign aims at expanding this success further.",
  "proposed_solutions.treating_parasites.description3": "Similar programs have reduced tsetse fly populations, saving countless animals from trypanosomiasis (also called sleeping sickness), a disease that slowly destroys their ability to think and move normally. These successes prove large-scale parasite elimination works. We just need the will to expand it.",
  "proposed_solutions.treating_parasites.how_to_help": "If you are in a situation where you can conduct research or influence policy on this topic, your help can be very important. You can also support initiatives like <1>Screwworm Free Future</1> and help spread the word about this issue.",
  "proposed_solutions.artificial_intelligence.title": "Artificial Intelligence",
  "proposed_solutions.artificial_intelligence.description1": "Artificial Intelligence is opening new possibilities for helping wild animals through better monitoring and smarter interventions. AI systems can process images from cameras and satellites to track animal populations and habitat conditions on a massive scale. They can map ecosystem relationships and predict vulnerabilities in food webs and migration routes before they become critical.",
  "proposed_solutions.artificial_intelligence.description2": "By understanding ecosystem changes better, AI can guide interventions that reduce suffering from human-wildlife conflicts, habitat destruction, and natural hazards. This approach helps us be better stewards of ecosystems while prioritizing individual animal welfare and sustainable coexistence.",
  "proposed_solutions.artificial_intelligence.description3": "It's also important that frontier AI systems like LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) learn to think about wild animals as individuals who matter, not just as parts of species or ecosystems. This could encourage more people to support efforts to help them.",
  "proposed_solutions.artificial_intelligence.how_to_help": "Contribute to citizen science projects that feed data into AI systems. Support organizations developing AI for conservation. If you have tech skills, volunteer with machine learning projects focused on reducing wild animal suffering.

However, despite the complexity of the human body and limitations of our understanding, we are still performing research and intervening based on careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits.
