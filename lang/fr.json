  "introduction.copy": "<p>When thinking about nature and the lives of wild animals, we often picture dolphins swimming in the ocean or elephants and lions roaming in the savannah. We mostly picture large adult animals living lives characterized by freedom. However, this rose-tinted view of nature doesn't even come close to representing the lives of most wild animals.</p><p>In reality, the life of most wild animals is characterized not by freedom, but by struggle. They constantly deal with harsh weather, starvation, disease, and injuries, and much like a dog or a human would suffer in their position, they suffer as well.</p>",

  "types_of_suffering.accidents.description": "Animals often suffer accidents and injuries in the wild. They may be injured by predators or in intraspecific conflicts over territory or mating; burned by wildfires or frozen by sudden frosts; trapped by difficult terrain such as mud ponds or frozen lakes, and face painful, lingering deaths; or they might simply have an accident in the normal course of living their lives, just as humans do. Unlike humans, though, animals in the wild rarely have effective help available to them when they endure accidents or injuries. They find themselves almost helpless against stronger animals, extreme weather conditions, and natural traps. Nevertheless, humans do sometimes manage to rescue injured or trapped animals, even in difficult circumstances.",
  "types_of_suffering.accidents.title": "Accidents",
  "types_of_suffering.anthropogenic_harms.description": "Anthropogenic harms are harms caused by human beings that are the direct result of specific actions, either intentional or unintentional. Examples of intentional direct harm are fishing and hunting. Another example is the intentional eradication of certain animals. This may be for economic reasons, such as when they are killed because of their negative impact on agriculture. It can also be for conservationist purposes, as when animals are killed because of their impact on other species. Examples of unintentional direct harm are when animals are injured or killed by harvesting machines or being run over by vehicles. Indirectly anthropogenic harms include harms that result from human action but are not the direct result of concrete actions.",

  "types_of_suffering.disease_and_parasitism.description": "There are so many diseases that affect nonhuman animals in nature that they cannot all be listed here. Some of them are illnesses humans can suffer from too, like flu, pneumonia, tuberculosis, cholera, ebola, anthrax, E. coli, salmonella, diphtheria, and rabies. Cancer is also common in both land and marine animals. Some populations of whales suffer from cancer at similar rates to humans. Other common diseases that can infect animals living in the wild are distemper, chronic wasting disease, African swine fever, worms, and a variety of fungal infections. Parasite infestations are also common, and are more prevalent and severe in animals whose immune systems are weakened by other factors, such as infectious disease, weather, malnutrition, bodily changes, or stress due to antagonistic relationships with other animals.",
  "types_of_suffering.disease_and_parasitism.title": "Disease & parasitism",
  "types_of_suffering.harmful_weather_conditions.description": "Weather, especially temperature, plays a major role in influencing whether animals can survive and be healthy in certain habitats. Fluctuations in temperatures in certain regions can result in the deaths of entire populations. Many animals suffer due to changes in temperature. They may be fine during part of the year but experience great discomfort and hardship during a particularly hot summer or cold winter. In temperate areas - such as large parts of North America, Europe, and Asia - there can be big differences between the minimum and maximum temperatures during the summer and the winter. Animals who don’t hibernate or become dormant in cold weather have to endure large variations in temperature. This may weaken their immune systems and make them more susceptible to illness.",
  "types_of_suffering.harmful_weather_conditions.title": "Weather conditions",
  "types_of_suffering.natural_disasters.description": "Animals living in the wild are particularly vulnerable in natural disasters. Earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and forest fires can have devastating consequences. Many animals die, drowned or buried alive by dirt, ash, lava, or snow; crushed to death in collapsed or burnt burrows; smashed against trees and rocks, or pelted by hailstones. Others sustain major injuries, including cuts and abrasions to the eyes, wings and gills; respiratory and digestive disorders, eroded teeth; malnutrition; and poisoning from contaminated food and water. Strong volcanic eruptions and fires can temporarily change regional weather, cooling or heating the air, changing winds, or causing rain.",
  "types_of_suffering.natural_disasters.title": "Natural disasters",
  "types_of_suffering.predation.description": "Animals who are preyed upon are killed and eaten in varied ways. Some predators routinely eat the animals alive. Some animals, such as herons and some species of snakes, swallow their prey whole and digest them alive. It's difficult to estimate the suffering undergone by animals while they are being hunted and killed. It’s important to note that as well as feeling pain when attacked, prey animals may experience psychological distress from living in fear of predators.",
  "types_of_suffering.predation.title": "Predation",
  "types_of_suffering.thirst_and_starvation.description": "Animals in the wild are suffering from starvation and dehydration, and it is easy to underestimate this problem. For instance, if an animal is on the verge of starving to death, they will be more susceptible to being caught by predators. We might think that predation is why the animal died, when the root cause of that happening was actually weakness or more risky behaviours due to starvation. When we consider the reproductive strategies and population dynamics of wild animals, it seems that the problem of resource scarcity is likely to be a significant source of suffering.",

  "videos.vegan_blind_spot.description": "In this 20 minute video, a logical case is presented for reducing the suffering of wild animals. Like farmed animals, wild animals are also in need of our help, but this is an issue that many animal advocates haven’t given much consideration.",
  "videos.was_introduction.title": "Wild Animal Suffering: An Introduction",
  "videos.was_introduction.description": "Suffering often outweighs happiness in the lives of wild animals as a result of malnutrition, disease, human impact, and more. It is possible to reduce wild animal suffering by rescuing and treating sick or injured animals. Humans intervene in nature to reduce our own suffering, and wild animals are owed the same moral consideration.",
  "videos.vegan_mistake.title": "Vegans And Meat-Eaters Both Make This Mistake",
  "videos.vegan_mistake.description": "Both vegans and meat-eaters often engage in the appeal to nature fallacy. Our idea of what is natural or unnatural is arbitrary, yet an appeal to nature is often used to justify things we would otherwise view as immoral or unjust, including wild animal suffering.",

  "videos.brown_university.description": "Welfare is the net value of an individual's subjective experience, which may also be called happiness or wellbeing. Wild animal welfare may be quantified by considering scale (the number of wild animals) and intensity. The Wild Animal Initiative is currently focused on building capacity to advance wild animal welfare.",

  "videos.vegan_world.title": "How a Vegan World Might Contain MORE Suffering",
  "videos.vegan_world.description": "Humane Hancock discusses the ethical implications of rewilding, replicating ecosystems on other planets, and simulations. Rewilding as practiced today often increases wild animal suffering while space colonization and simulations have potential to increase suffering without due moral consideration.",

  "videos.environmental_ethics.description": "Which entities deserve moral consideration? Ecocentrism values the preservation of ecosystems as a whole without regard for the wellbeing of individuals in them, whereas biocentrism values the wellbeing of all living beings. Arguments both for and against ecocentrism and biocentrism are presented.",
  "videos.was_solution.title": "How to SOLVE Wild Animal Suffering",
  "videos.was_solution.description": "In this half hour video, Humane Hancock discusses potential solutions to wild animal suffering. Topics include vaccinations against disease, fertility control to prevent starvation, and genetic engineering. He presents several examples of each method which have already been employed as well as objections to such methods.",
  "videos.ways_to_help.title": "Ways to help wild animals in need",
  "videos.ways_to_help.description": "The most common causes of wild animal suffering are starvation, disease, injuries and lack of shelter. Several methods to help wild animals are presented and examples are given, including treatment and prevention of disease, treatment of injuries, caring for orphaned animals and providing suitable shelter and other resources.",
  "videos.cosmic_skeptic.title": "Cosmic Skeptic on Wild Animal Suffering",
  "videos.cosmic_skeptic.description": "Humane Hancock sits down with fellow Youtuber Cosmic Skeptic for a long-form conversation on the issue of wild animal suffering. If we have a moral obligation to be vegan, do we also have a moral obligation to help wild animals? Their conversation touches on philosophy, environmentalism and biodiversity, and human overpopulation.",

  "common_objections.its_not_ours.content": "Some people argue that we are not responsible for the suffering of wild animals because we did not cause it. However, the reason to help animals is because they need our help. If we believe that it is our moral responsibility to help the most vulnerable members of society, regardless of whether or not we caused their suffering, then we should extend that same compassion to wild animals as well.",

  "common_objections.we_will_make_it_worse.content": "Some may  argue that intervening in nature to reduce animal suffering is likely to make things worse because ecosystems are complex and we don't fully understand them. However, despite the complexity of the human body and limitations of our understanding, we are still performing research and intervening based on careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits. While more research is needed on the potential impact of intervention, it is premature to conclude that any possible intervention will make things worse and we should approach the issue with an open mind and willingness to learn and adapt as we gain more knowledge and experience.

  "common_objections.nothing_we_can_do.content": "This is simply not true. There are already people who provide aid to sick, injured, or orphaned animals in need. And while it may be difficult to help wild animals on a larger scale, it is too early to conclude that we are unable to make things better for them. Due to the lack of research and attention on this issue, there is not enough evidence to say for certain that any attempt to help wild animals will inevitably fail. Even if large-scale intervention is currently impossible, we cannot predict what will be possible in the future.",

  "common_objections.cannot_consent.label": "But isn't wild animal suffering natural?",
  "common_objections.cannot_consent.content": "Yes, it's true that something being natural does not necessarily mean it is good. For example, smallpox was a natural occurrence, but it was ultimately a good thing that it was eradicated. The field of wild animal welfare challenges the common misconception that natural equals good. In fact, this may even be a reason to work on the issue: advocating for the welfare of wild animals may help us make moral progress by expanding our moral circle and potentially setting a precedent for addressing issues of digital sentience in the future.",

  "common_objections.too_big_of_a_problem.content": "Not being able to fully eliminate a problem is not a reason for why we should not make attempts at doing so. After all, despite the fact that suffering is an inevitable part of life, we still strive to make the lives of humans better through medical treatment, social support, and other interventions. Similarly, while the scale of wild animal suffering may be vast, implementing even small-scale interventions can make a significant difference to the individual animals we help. It is true that we may not be able to help every wild animal, but that does not diminish the value of helping those we can.",

  "common_objections.factory_farming_first.content": "While it is understandable that many animal advocates focus primarily on farmed animal suffering due to the greater tractability of the issue, it is still important to be aware of the issue of wild animal suffering due to the potential impact of our current and future actions. For example, rewilding programs often do not take into account the well-being of the individual animals they create or the potential to increase suffering through the development and spread of ecosystems containing wild animals to other environments.",
