        Though many ethicists have the intuition that we should leave nature
        alone, Kyle Johannsen argues that we have a duty to research safe ways
        of providing large-scale assistance to wild animals. Using concepts from
        moral and political philosophy to analyze the issue of wild animal
        suffering (WAS), Johannsen explores how a collective, institutional
        obligation to assist wild animals should be understood.

        Engaging and thought-provoking, this book examines how humans see and
        treat other animals and argues that we should extend equal consideration
        and respect to all beings, human and nonhuman alike. Our world is
        plighted by &quot;isms&quot; such as racism and sexism, but we may have
        overlooked a very important one: speciesism.

        In the past three decades, animal rights advocates have established
        everything from elephant sanctuaries in Africa to shelters that
        rehabilitate animals used in medical testing, to homes for farmed
        animals, abandoned pets, and entertainment animals that have outlived
        their “usefulness.” Saving Animals is the first major ethnography to
        focus on the ethical issues animating the establishment of such places.

        In 2020, COVID-19, the Australia bushfires, and other global threats
        served as vivid reminders that human and nonhuman fates are increasingly
        linked. Human use of nonhuman animals contributes to pandemics, climate
        change, and other global threats which, in turn, contribute to
        biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse, and nonhuman suffering.

        Protecting wild animals and preserving the environment are two ideals so
        seemingly compatible as to be almost inseparable. But in fact, between
        animal welfare and conservation science there exists a space of
        underexamined and unresolved tension: wildness itself. When is it right
        to capture or feed wild animals for the good of their species?

        Written by an expert in applied welfare aspects of physiology, this book
        is the first to address the physiological aspects of suffering in
        animals. It explores the different causes of suffering: physical
        discomfort, thirst and hunger, the responses in the body that lead to
        suffering and it offers insight into how suffering can be managed.
