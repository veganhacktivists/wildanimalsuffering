        Effective altruism is a project that aims to find the best ways to help
        others, and put them into practice. It&apos;s both a research field,
        which aims to identify the world&apos;s most pressing problems and the
        best solutions to them, and a practical community that aims to use those
        findings to do good.

        You have about 80,000 working hours in your career: 40 years x 50 weeks
        x 40 hours. If you want to have a positive impact with your life, your
        choice of career is probably your best opportunity to do that. That
        means it&apos;s worth thinking hard about how to use this time most
        effectively.
