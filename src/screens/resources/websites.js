        Effective altruism is a project that aims to find the best ways to help
        others, and put them into practice. It's both a research field, which
        aims to identify the world's most pressing problems and the best
        solutions to them, and a practical community that aims to use those
        findings to do good.

        Animals need you, and you need data. We conduct essential research,
        maintain an online research library, and directly support advocates and
        organizations in their work to save lives. The range of data we offer
        helps our movement understand how people think about and respond to
        advocacy, providing advocates with the best strategies to inspire change
        for animals.

        You have about 80,000 working hours in your career: 40 years x 50 weeks
        x 40 hours. If you want to have a positive impact with your life, your
        choice of career is probably your best opportunity to do that. That
        means it's worth thinking hard about how to use this time most
        effectively.
