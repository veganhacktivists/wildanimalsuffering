          Together, we can make life better for wild animals.
        </h2>
        <p className="font-lg">
          In recent years, there has been growing moral concern for animals.
          Thankfully, it is now rare to find a person who feels indifferent
          towards animal suffering. We know suffering feels bad to us. But we
          also know that suffering feels bad for a dog or a cat. And we also
          know that suffering feels bad for a pig, a chicken or a fish.
          Suffering feels bad for anyone who feels it, regardless of their
          species or their location. When you put yourselves into the
          perspective of the one who suffers, it doesn&apos;t matter whether
          they are in a house, a farm, or a forest. Their suffering matters. It
          matters to them. And it should matter to us.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="font-lg z-10">
          If it matters to you, then we encourage you to join us in our mission
          to make life better for wild animals. There is much to learn about the
          situation of wild animals. This page is just an introduction to the
          issue. In truth, it is very sad that so many animals are desperately
          in need of help right now. But luckily, humans like you have the
          opportunity to make a difference. We hope you choose to take it.
